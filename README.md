Welcome to `auto_graph`! This powerful C++ Python extension is designed to let you quickly and effectively build dependency graphs where nodes represent conditions and edges signify actions.

## Features :sparkles:

- **Quick Graph Building**: Easily create dependency graphs for managing your projectâ€™s workflow.
- **High Performance**: The graph runs in an optimized manner to ensure your build processes are swift and efficient.
- **Flexible**: Ideal for complex build systems like those in game development.
- **Comprehensive**: Can potentially replace your entire C++ build system!
- **Dynamic**: Can modify the graph at build time, allowing for powerful dynamic builds, such as dependency scans.
- **Debuggable**: You can view the graph as it progresses with a build and even replay the actions.

## Work In Progress :hammer_and_wrench:

Please note that `auto_graph` is currently under active development. We are working hard to enhance its capabilities and performance. Thus, we are not providing any examples at this moment, but stay tuned for updates! 

## Ideal Use Cases :video_game:

`auto_graph` shines in scenarios where you are dealing with complicated build systems, particularly in fields like game development, where managing dependencies and actions is crucial.

## Future Enhancements :rocket:

We are constantly working on improving `auto_graph` and have plans for many exciting features and optimizations. Keep an eye on this space for upcoming releases!
